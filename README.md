# Xiangqi Game Project
This README provides an overview of the Xiangqi game project implemented in Java. The project includes the complete logic for playing Xiangqi and covers all possible cases with extensive testing. Additionally, the project includes a GUI for the game in HTML/JavaScript, which was provided as a skeleton.

## Introduction
Xiangqi is a two-player strategy board game that originated in China. The game is also known as Chinese chess and is played on a board with 9 ranks (horizontal lines) and 10 files (vertical lines). The game is played with 32 pieces, which are divided into two armies, the red and black armies. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's general.

## Features
Our Xiangqi game project includes the following features:

- Complete logic for playing Xiangqi, including all possible moves, captures, checks, and checkmates.
- Extensive testing of the game logic to cover all possible cases and ensure correct behavior.
- A GUI for the game in HTML/JavaScript, which was provided as a skeleton and integrated into the project.

This project was made by Denis Koshelev, Daniil Alekseev, and Paulin Klawon as a homework for university course.
